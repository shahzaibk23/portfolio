summary: ChipShop is a cloud-based graphical user interface (GUI) that
  democratizes system-on-chip (SoC) design by simplifying the configuration and
  acceleration process on the open-source Chipyard platform. This user-friendly
  platform enables users to easily configure core types, caches, memory
  controllers, and other SoC features while supporting FPGA emulation, mapping,
  and the addition of new intellectual properties (IPs). ChipShop of ers
  automatic blackbox generation and integration for user-provided RTLs,
  streamlining the design process and reducing errors. The platform also
  includes real-time collaboration and version control features, making it ideal
  for large teams working on complex designs.
