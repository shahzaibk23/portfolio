summary: <b>M﻿ENTORED in LFX Mentorship Spring'23 by RISCV-V. </b>T﻿his Project
  Adding the support of Single Precision Floating Point (F) extension in
  NucleusRV Core would enable RISC-V to reach even more use-cases on the deeply
  embedded side. This way the SoC-Now Generator’s scope will also expand so that
  now the parameter to include the F extension in the Core will become
  available. Henceforth increasing the value of the Generator and the Core
  standalone itself. The SoC-Now generator furthermore uses two Frameworks
  Caravan and Jigsaw, for connecting Buses and Devices respectively in any
  CHISEL Design/IP.
