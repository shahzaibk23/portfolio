summary: <i>M﻿ENTORED in LFX Mentorship Spring'23 by RISC-V. </i><br>T﻿his
  Project aims to add the support of Single Precision Floating Point (F)
  extension of RISC-V in NucleusRV Core. This way the SoC-Now Generator’s scope
  will also expand so that now the parameter to include the F extension in the
