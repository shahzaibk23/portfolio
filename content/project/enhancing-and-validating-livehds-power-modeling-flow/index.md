  This project aims to improve and validate the power modeling flow of LiveHD, which is crucial for estimating power consumption in modern hardware designs. The current system needs improvements in stability, accuracy, compatibility, and performance. The project will tackle these issues by debugging the existing system, establishing a thorough validation methodology for power estimates, and optimizing the flow for larger netlists and VCD files. The project also plans to enhance the existing documentation with detailed explanations, examples, and tutorials to aid user understanding and adoption. The end goal is to provide a more reliable, accurate, and efficient power modeling flow in LiveHD, aiding the creation of energy-efficient hardware designs.
