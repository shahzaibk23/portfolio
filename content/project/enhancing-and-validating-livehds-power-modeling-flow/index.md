title: Enhancing and Validating LiveHD's Power Modeling Flow
date: 2023-06-19T12:47:15.005Z
summary: <ï»¿i> Contributor in GSoC'23 </i> <br>The primary goal of this project
  is to enhance and validate LiveHD's power modeling flow, a critical feature
  for estimating power consumption in modern hardware designs. The existing flow
  requires further refinement to ensure its stability, accuracy, compatibility
  with a wider range of netlists and VCD files, and overall performance. To
  address these challenges, the project will focus on methodically debugging the
  current implementation, establishing a comprehensive validation methodology
  for verifying the accuracy of power estimates, and optimizing the flow to
  handle larger netlists and VCD files efficiently. Additionally, the project
  aims to improve existing documentation by providing detailed explanations,
  examples, and tutorials to facilitate user adoption and understanding. Upon
  successful completion, the project will deliver a more reliable, accurate, and
  efficient power modeling flow within LiveHD, contributing to the development
  of energy-efficient hardware designs.
