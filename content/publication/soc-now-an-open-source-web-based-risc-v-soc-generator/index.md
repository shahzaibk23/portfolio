abstract: In the rapidly changing technological world of today, smart phones and
  other gadgets have taken over our daily lives. Every aspect of life is reliant
  on technology, or “smart devices.” And these devices are called “smart”
  because they contain a computing system inside called as processor or system
  on chip (SoC). Development of SoC is a quite long process. It can take months
  to build and develop a SoC from scratch. Following the design stage, testing,
  and verification of it adds another layer of stress. Designers like to reuse a
  verified component in their design to save time. However, this doesn’t save
  time because without adequate documentation, which is lacking in many
  contributions to open-source projects, it can be extremely challenging to
  grasp the functionality and usability of a component. The open-source
  semiconductor industry is therefore in need of software that can quickly
  produce or design a SoC rather than taking the designer years to complete the
  build or design. Alternately, any designer can also generate a component with
  sufficient documentation and plug and play support. SoC-Now is an open-source
  web-based RISC-V ISA standardised SoC design solution in terms of generator
  that enables anyone to create a SoC with their own customised specifications
  and then further process that SoC to the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
  Emulation. Additionally, it provides the capability to produce any standalone,
  verified, and reusable SoC component (Core, Device, Bus) by means of generic
  interfaces. A completely automated Verification system is also included.
