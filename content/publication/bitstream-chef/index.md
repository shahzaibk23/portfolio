abstract: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) technologies have become
  increasingly important in their fields of application with the open-source
  revolution in the silicon industry. These tools cover a wide range of
  automatic operations that save a significant amount of time. Bitstream Chef
  generates the bitstream of a design as shown in Fig.1 by taking an RTL design,
  allowing the user to map I/Os onto an FPGA using a GUI, and thus generating
  the bitstream through automated processes by use of an open-source tool F4PGA.
  Additionally, it uploads the Bitstream onto the connected FPGA board while
  also letting the user know whether any boards are currently connected. It will
  also allow user to either have pre-defined program embedded in the bitstream
  or upload the program separately through UART. For further moving the design
  toward GDS generation, it has the Open Lane toolchain integrated as well.
  Bitstream Chef is designed to be the go-to tool for every developer who
  frequently must upload or burn designs into FPGA, has a computer with less
  computing power.
