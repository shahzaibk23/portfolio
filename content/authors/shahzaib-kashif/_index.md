<p>I am a Research Assistant at MERL and a Software Engineering Graduate. I am majorly interested in designing hardware with the Software Engineering Methodologies using CHISEL HDL. I have been working on RISC-V ISA for the last 3+ years. I also have keen interest in Compilers, Edge Computing, and Tiny A.I/ML Models for Embedded/IoT Devices.</p>
